Assignment 2 comments:

Question 1: Algorithms. 8/10
UCS is still complete on infinite graphs, as is IDS.

Question 2:

eq: 5/5

goal: 5/5

BFS/DFS: 2/5
You're only generating 2 states, which seems weird.
--- Breadth-First Search ---
Total states generated: 2


--- Depth-First Search ---
Total states generated: 2

DLS: 10/10

tools: 10/10

decomposition: 10/10

Question 3:

read_mars_graph: 5/5

A*: 10/15
There's nothing to test your code, and it doesn't print a result.

count states: 0/5 not implemented

Question 4: 10/10

Question 5: 10/10 - this is pretty brief; please add more detail in the future.

85/100
